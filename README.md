> This project is a piano animation add-on for Blender, which automates the process of piano animation by parsing MIDI files. The goal of the project is to create an animation of piano keys being pressed and released (translated up and down the z-axis) in sync with the music track from a MIDI file and audio track from an MP3 file. This add-on provides two options: automatically generating a piano model and animating it, or using an already imported piano model and animating it.
